### Objective:
• Built a prediction model to correctly identify 'at risk' employees from HR attrition data with 50+ employee features.
• Found male employees who travel frequently, work at HR department, have a low salary hike, and live far from workplace
have a high probability of leaving the company.
• Created a dashboard in Tableau that would help any HR manager to retain the best talent by applying the correct strategies.
